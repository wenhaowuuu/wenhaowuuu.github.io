This post shows a published [study](https://www.routledge.com/The-Routledge-Companion-to-Artificial-Intelligence-in-Architecture/As-Basu/p/book/9780367424589) the author conducted while working at [Skidmore, Owings and Merill](https://www.som.com/). 
The author developed with his team a complete workflow of constructing and applying several Machine Learning models to analyze historical development data in the City of San Francisco.

## Project Background

The City of <b>San Francisco</b> has xxx.
<div id="folium-chart-4"></div>

###Where are the next real estate developments likely to happen?
<div id="folium-chart-1"></div>

## The Wealth of Data

<div id="folium-chart-2"></div>

## The Geospatial Layer of Things
The City encompasses various land uses, from residential to commercial and industrial. Below is a chart showing the breakdown land uses from the most general category to the more granular uses.

<div id="folium-chart-3"></div>

## Machine Learning Models and Preliminary Result
The model was constructed with four different algorithms.

## Interactive Mapping Tool
Developed with [Mapbox GL](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/). The model was constructed with four different algorithms.
